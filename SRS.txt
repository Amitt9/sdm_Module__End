Existing System:
 
 The company recruits graduates by maintaining manual records which involves many loop holes.
Drawbacks:
1. Redundancy:
 	Manual records tend to contain data which are redundant. This isbecause Normalization followed is consistent data base is missingfeature in manual records.
2. Inconsistency:
	Because of redundant data, there is no consistency in the data.
3. Time Consuming:
	Maintaining each students and employees data with muchnumber of fields is a tedious process and takes more time to retrieveback.
4. Improper Validation:
	There are many cases where validation is to be performedbetween the existing data and yet to be entered data. Also, a graduatewho appears for the interview and 	fails to succeed should 
	not bereconsidered until a period of 3 months.
5. Tedious:
	An organization data base goes through many numbers of updates each day which is hard to maintain in registers.
6. More HR:
	In order to maintain the information of all the employees andstudents who applied for different jobs a special group of employeesshould be hired, which 		ultimately tends to the waste of resources
